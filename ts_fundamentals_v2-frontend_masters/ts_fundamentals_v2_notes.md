## Introduction

### Introduction

-   Is typescript a separate language from Javascript? Explain!
-   What language does TS compile to?
-   Is it run time type checking?
-   It comes in three parts, what are they?

### Rationale

-   What does TS force the developer to encode?
-   What kind of mistakes does it eliminate?
-   Are errors caught at runtime or compile time with TS?
-   Subjective but does it provide a better Developer Experience? Why would you say so?

### Flags

-   What is the command line command to compile a .ts file into .js?
-   What version of js does ts compile to by default?
-   If you wanted to comile to ES2015, how would you do that on the command line?
-   What flag would you use to compile to Node js code?
-   What flag would you use to constantly compile on change of ts file?
-   Are flags the only way to vary the output?
