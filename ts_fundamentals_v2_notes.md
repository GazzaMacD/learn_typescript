# TypeScript Fundamentals

## Introduction

### Introduction

-   Is typescript a separate language from Javascript? Explain!
-   What language does TS compile to?
-   Is it run time type checking?
-   It comes in three parts, what are they?

### Rationale

-   What does TS force the developer to encode?
-   What kind of mistakes does it eliminate?
-   Are errors caught at runtime or compile time with TS?
-   Subjective but does it provide a better Developer Experience? Why would you say so?

### Flags

-   When compiling with typescript, what is the default version of javascript it compiles to?
-   What is the command line code to compile a typescript file?
-   What is the flag you would put on the command line to compile to say, ecma script 2015?
-   If compiling for node, what flag should we use?
-   If wanting the ts compiler to update output js files as you type in the typescript compiler, what flag would you use?
